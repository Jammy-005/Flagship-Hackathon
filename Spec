Idea:
App with health stats in a generalised format
Approximations of how far a person has walked
Average amount needed to be healthy
Stats for screen time / time on phone
Health “streak” - How many days in a row a person has met the health quota
Ability to lock users out of their phone until they meet a health quota - walked a certain amount
Widget / Interactive Ability
Shows amount currently walked / how much more needed
Encouragement / shame - Notifications + home screen widgets (can show various useful things like health progress / quota, weather / encouragement to step outside)
Interaction with weather API / user location / AI
Inclusion of advice / weather to 
Use of location to track distance walked / time outside
POSSIBLE INCLUSION OF PARASOCIAL AI - USE SOME SORT OF PERSONA AND REPLY IN THAT “CHARACTER” THROUGH CHAT GPT PROMPTS
REWARDS SYSTEM IS TO GET ACCESS TO THE WAIFUGPT
In the pitch, say expansion to more characters, more personas
CUTS YOU OFF IF YOU FAIL YOUR STREAK

UI
Frontend (Daniel):
Priorities:
Lock screen UI (i.e. message depending on internet hygiene, bedtime usage, specific message relating on the content of phone usage i.e. social media, streak)
Make sure UI is good UI so if you feel like a message has to be presented differently, do it. The list is just content that is suited to be on there.
